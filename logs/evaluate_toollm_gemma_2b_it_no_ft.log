In London, where the Olympics thrived,
The weather painted a different tide.
Beneath azure skies, a story was told,
Of a city resilient, standing bold.

Sunbeams danced on Buckingham green,
A symphony of nature's team.
A gentle breeze carried a gentle sigh,
As the world gathered beneath the sky.

From the heart of the Thames to the shore so white,
Nature's canvas painted against the light.
The Olympic flame flickered on with grace,
Guiding athletes to a world of their own space.

In this realm of dreams, the world took flight,
A testament to human might.
London, the victor, a city reborn,
With a spirit that forever remained.<eos>

In London's heart, a tale unfolds,
A tale of weather, cold and bold.
The air is crisp, the sky a hue,
Of azure and gray, a sight to view.

The Olympic flame burns bright,
As athletes strive, with all their might.
But nature's symphony is heard,
A contrasting sound, unheard.

The sun descends, a golden hue,
Casting a glow that can't be overthrown.
Yet, a gentle breeze whispers low,
Reminding us of a world both cold and snow.

So, here's to London's weather today,
An enigma that's both calm and coy.
The Olympics have come to an end,
But the memory of nature remains.<eos>
